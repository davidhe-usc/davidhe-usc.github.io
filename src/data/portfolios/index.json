    "description": "Served as Technical Art Lead and Gameplay Engineer for 'That's Not How It Happened', a narratively-driven multi-genre experience. Created as a collaboration between USC's Advanced Games Projects and Master of Fine Arts Theses Projects, TNHIH utilizes the Rashomon Effect to tell the story of a family inn burning down from several different perspectives. Each one of these different perspectives is encapsulated in unique gameplay experiences, leaving the audience to puzzle through a dynamically-evolving story. Personal responsibilities included Art Pipeline Development, Gameplay Engineer, UI Artist, Animator and Rigger, as well as VFX and Shader Artist.

Done primarily to flesh out a fanfiction concept exploring Private Military Corporations. Pieces currently displayed here include the ASW-G-24 Naberius and the STH-18 Eihei Commander Type, with several other variations that can be viewed on my ArtStation. Due to their status as concept pieces, they are derived off other Mobile Suit artwork and should be considered an exhibition of design skill rather than pure art skill. Current efforts are being made to model and rig the STH-18 in Maya. Gundam Frame Pose Reference from https://twitter.com/yuichiAxesset/status/1011912819594313728",
